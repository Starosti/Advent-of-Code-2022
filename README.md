# Advent of Code 2022
These are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2022. They are not made with the best possible algorithms, instead are written with the first algorithm that came to my mind which are short. I do not have readability in mind while writing these scripts. Also, I have not included the input files, but they are numbered for each puzzle as `input<puzzle_number>.txt`.
